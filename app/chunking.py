"""Chunking. TODO 1.

One decision, two numbers, and they trade against each other. Smaller chunks
raise the chance that a retrieved passage is entirely on topic and lower the
chance that the whole answer is inside one of them. Larger chunks do the
reverse.

The thing that makes the trade measurable is that every chunk keeps its
doc_id and its section. The gold set names sections, the scorer resolves
sections to chunk ids at scoring time, and so the same gold set scores any
size you try. If chunks lost their section, changing the chunker would
invalidate the gold set and the sweep in block 3 would be impossible.

    becomes impossible.

    Two details that are easy to get wrong and expensive to debug.

    Prepend the section heading to the chunk text. A chunk that reads
    "Fees\nThe annual fee is 60 euros" embeds differently from one that
    reads "The annual fee is 60 euros", and the heading is often the only
    place the topic word appears. It is the cheapest retrieval improvement
    in this lab.

    The stride is `size - overlap`, not `size`. Get it wrong and you either
    drop text between chunks or repeat almost all of it, and both look fine
    until a number goes missing from the middle of a section.
